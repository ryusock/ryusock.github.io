    <p>Hi! My name is Seokhyeon, but you can call me by my nickname, Sock. I'm a recent UC Berkeley graduate with an interest in web application development, data science, and information systems. I'm currently based in Metro Detroit.</p>
    <p>Last summer, I interned as a software engineer at <a href="http://productbio.com/">ProductBio</a>. I was also a web developer at <a href="http://thedesignexchange.org">TheDesignExchange</a> and a data journalist on the <a href="https://dailycal-projects.tumblr.com/">Projects team</a> at <a href="http://dailycal.org">The Daily Californian</a>.</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out via <a href="mailto:ryusock@gmail.com" target="_top">email</a>. You can also find me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/seokhyeonryu">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ryusock">GitHub</a>. Check out my <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>, too.</p>

        <p>I analyzed which buses around UC Berkeley arrive later than expected by polling public bus data every minute for weeks (more than 45,000 bus trips in total). Delays were calculated based on deviation from published bus prediction times, and compared by stop, route, and time of day. Published in <em>The Daily Californian</em>.</p>
